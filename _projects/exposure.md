The performance focuses on the community of people (from New Aliens Agency) as a redefined strategy in contemporary art. 

We redefine both the professional model in the fashion industry and the approach to the performance. We re-discover the power and need to work with pathos and realness. 

In the simplest forms and human principles, we build the overall visual identity of the work and create experiences among spectators and nonmodels.

The community can be perceived at the same time as a human body that makes up a huge number of cells. Each cell - a nonmodel/tool - has its own specific code, its exceptional relationship to reality and its own movements, mimicry, behavior, outfit expresses its noncompliance with the system and at the same time

even sympathy, because New Aliens must be part of the system to communicate.
