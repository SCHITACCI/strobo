I decided to develop one of the medium I often use in my performance art. This medium is text - words, metaphors and statements.   
I was trying to connect the text with image, but it was not enough. So I made these videos of my alterego. And from this point I realized the connection to my Instagram and fast snapshots culture so I made these moving selfies, where each of them is dedicated to one layer of my personality (biological, political, spiritual..etc). In the final video I experimented with the cut to find same words in same time in different alteregoes.
