Moving selfies where each of them is dedicated to one layer of my personality (biological, pragmatical, spiritual, political and sexual). I used psychic automatism and a stream of ideas to create multimedia self portrait. I have observed the connection between ideas and how clothing styling affects a person. How colors affect our consciousness. And vice versa.

In the final installation I experimented with the editing in the term of finding moments where same words were spoken in the same time in different ,,alter egoes''.
