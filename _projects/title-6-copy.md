This series is fundamental for Jakub in terms of carnal aesthetics and the discovery of beauty diversity. They are not afraid of internal structures, unknown contexts or extreme positions. In this series, Jakub penetrated beyond his comfort zone and managed to get him a new dimension, refreshing and gloomy at the same time, a bright and at the same time a dark moment of self-existence or self-reflection in the connection to the external environment and the inner rhythm. 

From a quiet inner temperament, he gets a whole range of presentations or representations of psychosocial feelings present in these special harmonic images that show the body in an unusual state of mind in the state of a new balancing.
