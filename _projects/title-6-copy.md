This series is fundamental for me in terms of carnal aesthetics and the discovery of beauty diversity. I am not afraid of internal structures, unknown contexts or extreme positions. In this series, I penetrated beyond my comfort zone and managed to get myself a new dimension, refreshing and gloomy at the same time, a bright and at the same time a dark moment of self-existence or self-reflection in the connection to the external environment and the inner rhythm.

From a quiet inner temperament, I get a whole range of presentations or representations of psychosocial feelings present in these special harmonic images that show the body in an unusual state of mind in the state of a new balancing.
