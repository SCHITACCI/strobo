This collection was made during the Studio Vortex Residency in France with leader Antoine d'agata. I was trying to work like a Medium which were licking, depicting, asking, performing and living as well.

Every picture was made in the moment of relaxed and positive state of mind. I decided to use it here, in Arles, because it is something which I missed in Prague a lot.

To go over the classic point of view. To depict the reality in different approach. Body shapes. Liquids. Universal energy from everything. Metaphors. Medium transformed positive mood into deeper feelings, frustrations, desires or escapes via camera. Everything blurred the boundaries.
