Triptych carries an abstract story inspired by the experiences of LGBTQ + young people. Vulnerability, frustration, fear, sexuality and desire are present. Bodies are the medium for transforming energy and human fluids. The final compositions and colors are selected by intuition. The name is taken from the hip-hop subculture, where gay boys look for a certain type of exciting masculinity.
