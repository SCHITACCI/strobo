New Aliens is theÂ nonmodel agency, which is unique in its holistic approach. Agency combines trendsetting, forecasting, art and community of extraordinary people who, through their activities, are critical to existing systems and offering various alternatives. The agency represents not only nonmodels, but also dancers or artists in various media.

Agency dedicated to humanity, diversity, and nonconformity. Vivid and natural various forms, proportions and appearances are absolutely true, native and veracious attitudes of our human nature and what is missing is a more opened wide representation of otherness,  
queerness, awkwardness, strangeness among living being in public spaces.
