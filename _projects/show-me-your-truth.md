When you think of it, teeth are amazing – they can be used to chomp down on your fave meal or gently nibble on your boo when it comes to sexy times. You can sink them into the skin of your enemies, or charm your crushes with a dazzling smile. Yet, a lot of people are too afraid or embarrassed to show their fangs because they’re not as perfect as those pearly whites you see in ads. But you know what? Screw that! No matter if crooked, yellow, or full of cavities, your teeth are bringing you so much joy, so stop hiding them and start celebrating them now.
