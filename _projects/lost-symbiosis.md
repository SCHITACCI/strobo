The exhibition responded to the ecological footprints left behind by people. The meat and dairy industry, racism, homophobia, and the post-capitalist way of life. There was also a performance where I created new positive energies with the help of a musical instrument and connected to the global consciousness of the whole world. Visitors of the exhibition wrote different feedbacks on my back.
