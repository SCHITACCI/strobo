_This exhibition was a tribute to my muse dancer MONINA. I often do some projects and fashion performances with her, which helping me to present clothes. I used the sound of binaural frequencies to create kind of sacral space with vibrations. I affiliated curatorial text with the installation, because its classic form i find already dead._

WE CORRUPT OUR STORIES. THE IDEAS ARE GONE. LEFT IMAGE. RIGHT EYE. STORYTELLER SQUEEZERS AND THEN HERE YOU ARE. THE MARKER. THE COLLECTOR. FUCKING NOTHING. BLESS YOUR IDEAS. YOUR SECOND SUPPORTER. YOUR STATUE MONOCLE. DRY YOUR VOICE OUT. SHOW YOUR MAGIC. CHAOS.

Curatorial text by Mgr. Peter Susan Šagát PhD. / university teacher, trend-setter
