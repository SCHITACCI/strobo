The residence was orientated mainly into community based events open to public:

BETWEEN WORLDS - discussion, lecture by PXS  
We invite those who grew up in two cultures. We invite those who carry two national identities. We invite those who condemned their original identity. We invite those who feel they are slowly loosing their roots. We invite those who feel sensitive about the symbols of home and mother country. We invite those who are not afraid to speak about intimacy. We will talk in a circle sharing what it means to live in an ethnic minority. We’ll try to build hype, overcome the barrier, join together, and find understanding and empathy within the circle. (Zeynab Gueye, Ming Thang)  
Mgr. Peter Susan Šagát Phd. will present his multimedia flow dealing with topics such as vulnerability, emotions, intuition, intimacy and sexuality. With his performative approach he will explore the concentration of information as well as the viewers’ attention.
