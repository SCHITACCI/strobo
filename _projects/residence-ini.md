The Residence address the issues of the nature and vulnerability of our self, which are undoubtedly associated with identity, ego, gender, and society. In a safe environment where there is no hierarchy, however, new visions of the hybrid future can be developed. Keywords are a synthesis, intuition, community and consciousness. The residence was orientated mainly into community based events open to public:

NEW FEM - Discussion, performance, exhibition,afterparty.  
Discussion on the current forms of feminism. How do men approach these issues? Feminism as an intersection of all present social problems? Decentralization of communities leadership. To be discussed by the New Aliens with the public and their guests: Darina Alster, Hynek Alt, Denise Konečná, Tereza Stejskalová and Jiří Procházka.

EDUCATIONXXX - Discussion on young people’s alternative education. What does true education mean to the generation of Millennials? What needs to be redefined? Why are young people more and more discontent within the classical educational system? What can they do for themselves? And how to communicate these problems to their parents?

MINDFULNESS - a lecture, discussion with guests + happening  
In the current society, what role is played by persons with mental disorder? How does the New Aliens community work with nonmodels that have a mental “illness” diagnosis? Problems and questions about our mind and shattered head. The main point will be a hosted discussion “My Name Is Not a Diagnosis” as part of the NA ROVINU initiative, which will attempt to sum up the topic of mental health, and three guests will give account of their life story and problems they have experienced concerning the mental health issue.  
The New Aliens and members of the NA ROVINU initiative will launch discussion with the public and their guests. After the lecture, a happening in the form of a breathing meditation under professional guidance will take place.

JUICE ME - Discussion on the trend of drinking cold press vegan juices.  
Why is juicing the last trend in healthy food? And is it a mere trend or a natural development in a post-capitalist society and an answer to the planet’s environmental problems? The discussion will evolve between New Aliens, the public and the guests. Starring - fruitarians and nonmodels Alex Wortex and Jaspit. [DISCUSSION HERE](https://youtu.be/WybYKcIlajI)

BETWEEN WORLDS - discussion, lecture by PXS  
We invite those who grew up in two cultures. We invite those who carry two national identities. We invite those who condemned their original identity. We invite those who feel they are slowly loosing their roots. We invite those who feel sensitive about the symbols of home and mother country. We invite those who are not afraid to speak about intimacy. We will talk in a circle sharing what it means to live in an ethnic minority. We’ll try to build hype, overcome the barrier, join together, and find understanding and empathy within the circle. (Zeynab Gueye, Ming Thang)  
Mgr. Peter Susan Šagát Phd. will present his multimedia flow dealing with topics such as vulnerability, emotions, intuition, intimacy and sexuality. With his performative approach he will explore the concentration of information as well as the viewers’ attention.
